# My process

- I used html and css for the construction of this project
for HTML i have used tags and on the CSS there is use of classes and syntaxes

## Built with

- HTML (HyperText Markup Language)
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

## What I learned
I understood that there are different ways to write css. My mentor made me discover a website for the assimilation of difference
While creating this website, I put to work the lessons of creating a responsive design using flex boxes or grids
